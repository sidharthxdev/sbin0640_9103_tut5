One of the key aspects that attracted me to creative coding was the ability to experiment with art. As someone who isn't very interested with coding as a professional use case to build products and solutions, a creative approach to combine art and design to generate and experiment with different styles and interactive concepts made more sense. 

Based on this a few things that define my taste primary from things in my surrounding that I easily get attracted to. These inlcude different types of printing techniques, the retro graphical elements, hardware design especially volume knobs and button clicks and brutalist evironments. 

Inspired by these, I envision my project to have a connection that anyone can realate with physical environment or a product in a digital space. These would include using few of various aspects of human intecativity like touch, sound or vision.

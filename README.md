What attracted me to creative coding was the ability to experiment with art. As someone who isn't very interested with coding as a professional use case to build products & solutions, a creative approach to combine art and design to experiment made more sense. 

My taste revolves around my surroundings - printing techniques, retro graphics, hardware design, and brutalist environments. 

For my project, I envision crafting digital experiences that evoke the familiarity of physical objects, engaging users through touch, sound, or visual interaction to bridge digital and physical realms, making art accessible and relatable through interactive, sensory-driven design.

### Part 02: Coding Technique Exploration

To evoke tactile, retro, and hardware-inspired experiences, I would be using generative graphics with interactive UI elements using p5.js trying to simulate physical textures, retro visuals, interactive elements like knobs, buttons, and dials, and use layering techniques to mimic risograph textures. By also leveraging mouse/touch events, sound input, and animation to create immersive, sensory-driven digital art. This technique allows for experimentation with visual styles, interactivity, and real-time feedback.

**Genuary by Pizza Punk** 
Genuary, is a yearly challenge where artists and developers create generative art using only code—no graphic design software.
